## Overview

This is a multi-part project that aims to build a Tic-Tac-Toe game with different components:

1. **Tic-Tac-Toe Console App**: A console application where users can play Tic-Tac-Toe against each other locally.

2. **Tic-Tac-Toe Server**: A .NET server that allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe remotely from the console app.

3. **Tic-Tac-Toe UI with .NET MAUI**: A cross-platform UI built using .NET MAUI for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three parts, each in its own folder:

1. `TicTacToe`: Contains the console application for playing Tic-Tac-Toe locally.

2. `TicTacToeServer`: Contains the .NET server for remote gameplay.

3. `TicTacToeUI`: Contains the cross-platform UI using .NET MAUI.

## Goals

With this project I aim to develop an understanding of C#, .net, and .net MAUI.
